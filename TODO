more work on exceptions and error handling, and also testing of
   exceptions

clean up weight and max_depth argument parsing, it's a bit all over
   the place

feature idea: make a weight_fcd_of (perhaps named differently) which allows
   you to determine the weight for a given rule depending on the depth
   of another rule. this is handy if you have some higher rule method
   which calls another rule method which has several choices, and you
   want the choice to be contingent on the higher method's depth.
